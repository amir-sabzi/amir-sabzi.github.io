I am a research staff member at Computer Science Department of the University of British Columbia in [Systopia Lab](https://systopia.cs.ubc.ca/). I have recently graduated from UBC with an M.Sc. in Computer Science, where I was advised by [Prof. Aastha Mehta](https://aasthakm.github.io/) and [Prof. Mathias LÃ©cuyer](https://mathias.lecuyer.me/). Before, joining UBC, I was a research intern (remote) at [University of Vienna](https://www.univie.ac.at/en/) working with [Prof. Stefan Schmid](https://schmiste.github.io/).

I am broadly interested in Security and Privacy of Computer Systems. My research focuses on designing practical systems that are firmly rooted in solid theoretical foundations.  In particular, I am interested in differential privacy, network side-channels, and private machine-learning.

You can find my CV [here](/assets/pdf/AmirSabzi_CV_Oct.pdf).
